    <h2>Delicious Crunchy Loaded Nachos</h2>
    <p>Cinco de Mayo is almost here, and who doesn’t love nachos? Despite what was served at elementary school cafeteria lunches, nachos do not have to mean stale chips with a bland cheese sauce. Discovering real nachos is revolutionary! Chips, cheese, meat, beans, veggies, yum! </p>
    <p>History Lesson: Nachos were created by Ignacio “El Nacho” Anaya in 1943 in Mexico. He created a new snack for the wives of soldiers stationed at Fort Duncan, frying cut tortillas and adding shredded cheese and pickled jalapeños. He called them, “Nacho Especiales.”  </p>
