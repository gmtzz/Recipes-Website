        <h2>Asian Lo-Mein Recipe</h2>
        <p>This was a blend of multiple lo mein recipes I found. Add your favorite meat for a main dish, or make as a side dish to your favorite homemade chinese dinner.
             If you use meat, cook the meat in the pan first, and then pull out and set aside.</p>
             <h3>Ingredients</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
                </li>
                <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
                </li>
                <li>2 tbsp teriyaki sauce
                </li>
                <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp ginger</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oik</li>
                <li>3 stalks celery, sliced</li>
                <li>2 large carrots, cut into large matchsticks</li>
                <li>1/2 sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 green onion, sliced</li>

             </ul>
             <h3>Steps</h3>
             <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Rinse spaghetti with cold water to cool; drain.</li>
                <li>Whisk soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, honey, and ground ginger together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook and stir celery, carrots, sweet onion, and green onion in the hot oil until slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes; add spaghetti and sauce mixture. Continue to cook, tossing to mix, until the noodles and sauce are hot, about 5 minutes more.</li>
             </ol>
